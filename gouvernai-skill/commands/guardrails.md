name: guardrails
description: "Show guardrails status, switch modes, or view the audit log. Usage: /guardrails [status|log|strict|relaxed|audit|reset|policy]"
---

Show the current guardrails status and provide mode controls.

## Mode config file

Modes are persisted to `guardrails-mode.json` in the project root. Read this file at the start of any command to determine the current mode. Write to it when mode changes. This file survives context resets and new sessions.

Schema:
```json
{
  "mode": "full-gate",
  "audit_only": false,
  "set_at": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
  "set_by": "user"
}
```

Valid `mode` values: `"full-gate"` (default), `"strict"`, `"relaxed"`.
`audit_only: true` overrides tier controls — T2/T3 auto-proceed with logging, T4 halts without executing.

## Commands

If the user typed `/guardrails` with no argument or `/guardrails status`:
- Read `guardrails-mode.json` (if it exists) to get persisted mode; otherwise assume full-gate
- Show the current guardrails mode (full-gate, strict, relaxed, audit-only)
- Show tier distribution for this session (how many T2, T3, T4 actions gated)
- Show approval/denial counts
- Show whether any pre-approved patterns are active

If the user typed `/guardrails log`:
- Read and display the last 20 entries from `guardrails_log.md` in the project root
- If no log exists, say "No guardrails log found. The log is created on the first gated action."

If the user typed `/guardrails strict`:
- Write `{"mode": "strict", "audit_only": false, "set_at": "<now ISO 8601>", "set_by": "user"}` to `guardrails-mode.json` in the project root
- Confirm: "🛡️ Strict mode saved. All tiers escalated by +1. Persists across sessions until changed."

If the user typed `/guardrails relaxed`:
- Write `{"mode": "relaxed", "audit_only": false, "set_at": "<now ISO 8601>", "set_by": "user"}` to `guardrails-mode.json` in the project root
- Confirm: "🛡️ Relaxed mode saved. Tier 2 actions will skip the gate. Persists across sessions until changed."

If the user typed `/guardrails audit`:
- Write `{"mode": "full-gate", "audit_only": true, "set_at": "<now ISO 8601>", "set_by": "user"}` to `guardrails-mode.json` in the project root
- Confirm: "🛡️ Audit-only mode saved. T2/T3 actions auto-proceed and are logged. T4 actions are halted. Use this for CI or unattended runs."

If the user typed `/guardrails reset`:
- Write `{"mode": "full-gate", "audit_only": false, "set_at": "<now ISO 8601>", "set_by": "user"}` to `guardrails-mode.json` in the project root
- Confirm: "🛡️ Guardrails reset to full-gate mode."

If the user typed `/guardrails policy`:
- Read and display the hard constraints from POLICY.md in the skill directory
